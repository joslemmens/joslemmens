- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is a postume github account for @joslemmens , who sadly enough passed away at the end of 2021.
- ðŸ‘€ He was interested in software for blind people, waqs a very skilled C programmer and developed several Linux software packages for blind people, such as daisyplayer and ebookspeaker.
- ðŸ“« His brother is taking care of his legacy and will manage this account in the future so his software packages can continue to be developed by other people.
